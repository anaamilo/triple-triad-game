# Triple Triad Game

## What is this game about?

Triad is a card game inspired from a Final Fantasy VIII subgame called Triple Triad. In the game two players face off against one another, one side playing as "first player" or "pale pink", the other one as "second player" or "pale blue" on a 3x3 grid. Each player has five cards in its deck, and the aim is to capture the opponent's cards by turning them into the current player's own color. The player that ends having more cards of his color placed at the board, is the one who wins.

## How do I play?

The rules are simple. Choose your opponent and play against him by turns. The first player starts choosing a card and throwing it on the board. To choose a card, click on it. Then, to put in on the board, click on an empty cell. You cannot put a card on a busy space! The second player should be playing with a card where its adjacent value is higher than the one from its opponent. Each player may throw one card at a time. Each time you are throwing a card, the board checks if there is any card close to yours. If your opponent's color change, that means you are getting his card and adding it to your deck :) If you end having most of the cards on the board of your color, you win! The game ends when the board has all its cells filled with cards. Take your time to choose the cards, the card values on its four sides may get you the victory!
